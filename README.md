# Water Quality Treatment

## Overview
This project focuses on assessing water quality using various clustering algorithms. The goal is to classify water sources based on their quality and determine compliance with established standards.

## Features

- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied K-Means clustering to group water samples based on quality parameters. This method helps in identifying distinct clusters within the data.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Used hierarchical clustering to build a hierarchy of clusters. This approach provides a tree-like structure that helps visualize the nested clusters in the data.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Implemented DBSCAN to identify clusters in the data based on the density of points. This method is particularly effective in identifying clusters of varying shapes and handling noise in the data.

- **OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)**: Similar to DBSCAN, OPTICS was used to identify density-based clusters. It also provides better handling of varying density clusters and a more comprehensive view of the clustering structure.

- **Mean-Shift Clustering**: Utilized Mean-Shift clustering to identify the center of dense regions in the data, helping to form clusters based on the data's distribution.

- **Best Model Selection**: After testing various clustering algorithms, DBSCAN was identified as the best model for this dataset due to its ability to handle noise and identify clusters of varying shapes and densities.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **K-Means Clustering**: Standard clustering algorithm that groups data into a specified number of clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters, providing a visual tree structure.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering method, ideal for discovering clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise.
- **OPTICS**: Similar to DBSCAN, but provides more detailed information on cluster structure.
- **Mean-Shift**: Identifies clusters by locating dense regions in the data.
